            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Pet. 1.21. Epheſ. 2.20. Iohn. 5.24.39. and 20.29.31. 1. Cor. 1.21. 2. Tim. 1.10. and 2.5. Tit. 1.1. 2. Rom. 1.16. Pſal. 32.1. and 1.1. and 119.1. and ſo forward. Mat. 5.3. &amp; ſo forward.

               <p>Of the word of God there be two partes: the firſt concerning faith. Act. 24.14.15.16. Rom. 1.16. Hab. 2.4. the other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning good workes. Iam. 2.20. Phil. 1.27. Tit. 3.8. Mar. 1.15. 1. Tim. 1.18.19.<note place="margin">Of faith.</note>

               <p>The firſt part, namely concerning faith, doth teach vs, what we muſt beleeue to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. And that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerneth either God, or the

               <p>God, is an eternall, infinite, omnipotent, <note place="margin">Of God.</note> and moſt holy ſpirit. Iohn 4.24. Pſal 9.2. &amp; 92.8. &amp; 102.13. Eſa. 63.16. Dan. 6.26. Heb. 1.12.

               <p>Of the knowledge of God, or of faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God, are two parts, the firſt concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the eſſence of God, the ſecond concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his workes.</p>
               <p>The eſſence of God, is the nature of God, whereby God is indeede, and doth ſubſiſt.</p>
               <p>And that eſſence is but one: and therefore God is but onely one alſo.</p>
               <p>There are two partes of the knowledge of the eſſence of God, the firſt concerning the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of God, the ſecond concerning the diſtinction of the perſons.</p>
               <p>The attributes of God, are thoſe titles, which are attributed to God, to declare his eſſence better vnto vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God.</note>The attributes of God, are either ſimple, or compared.</p>
               <p>The ſimple attributes of God are the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ential properties of God, which doe agree to him without compariſon.</p>
               <p>Of theſe ſome haue ſuch a ſimilitude of him, as is in the creatures by creation: ſome haue not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:22308:7"/>Of the former kind are bleſſednes, immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie, vnderſtanding, praeſcience, memorie, will, goodneſſe, holineſſe, iuſtice, clemencie, long ſufferance, patience, conſtacie, fortitude, truth, faithfulneſſe, and the reſt.</p>
               <p>The goodneſſe of God is that, by which he hath bene euerlaſtingly contented with him ſelfe, not hauing neede of any other thing. 1. Tim. 1.11. &amp; 6.15.</p>
               <p>The vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of God, is that by which he hath a perfect vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of al things, &amp; this is ſomtimes called the wiſdome of God.</p>
               <p>The immortalitie of God, is that by which he neuer dieth. 1. Tim. 1.17. &amp; 6.16.</p>
               <p>The praeſcience of God, is a moſt perfect foreknowledge of all things to come.</p>
               <p>The memorie of God, is that by which he doth moſt exactly remember all things. Pſal. 25.6.7. Eſa. 49.16.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of the will of God.</note>The will of God, is that by which he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all things. Rom 9.15.22. Eph. 1.5.9.11.</p>
               <p>And that will is onely one, &amp; moſt ſimple if we reſpect God him ſelf, but ſo farre as we reſpect me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is either reuealed or hid, it is two fold: manifeſt or ſecret. The ſchoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men do call the former of theſe, the wil of the ſigne, the other the will of the good pleaſure of God.</p>
               <p>The ſecret wil alſo in due time appointed by God, is made open and manifeſt.</p>
               <p>The will of God is moſt free, whereupon alſo it is called the free will of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:22308:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>The free wil of God, is that ſelf ſame eſſence of God, vnderſtanding by it ſelfe all things immediatly and moſt perfectly, &amp; that moſt freely, but yet vnchangeably and neceſſarily, willing that which is good onely, and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that onely which is euill, neither depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of another former beginning, but of it ſelfe onely. And this alone may properly be called of his owne power.</p>
               <p>The goodnes of God is that by which he is the author of all good things.</p>
               <p>And he doth exerciſe this, either general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards all creatures, or elſe particularly towards his elect.</p>
               <p>The former is called beneficence, the later is called mercie.</p>
               <p>The beneficence of God, is that by which he giueth his gifts to all his creatures. Mat. 5.44.45. Act. 14.17.</p>
               <p>The mercie of God is that by which God doth good to his elect, although they deſerue nothing of him but euill. Eſa. 49.10.13. Eph. 2.3.4. Pſal. 145.9.</p>
               <p>The holineſſe of God is that by which he doth altogether abhorre all impuritie &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleaneſſe Eſa. 6.3. Reu. 4.8. Ierem. 3.12.</p>
               <p>The iuſtice of God, is that by which he dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth iuſtly in all things. Pſal. 116.11. Rom. 3.4.</p>
               <p>The clemencie of God, is that by which he doth repreſſe his anger, which is moſt iuſt, that he might ſpare vs. Exod. 34.5.</p>
               <p>The long ſufferance of God, is that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:22308:8"/>he doth a long time defer his anger, and puniſhment againſt ſinners, that he might prouoke them to repentance. Exod 34.5.</p>
               <p>The patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God is that by which he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth a long time patiently the ſins of men, that he might lead the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to repentance. Eſa. 48.9</p>
               <p>The conſtancie of God, is that by which he performeth moſt certainely that which hee hath ſpoken. Exod. 34.5.</p>
               <p>The fortitude of God, is that by which he is able to performe all thinges that hee doth wil. 1 Sam. 2.2. 2 Sam. 23.13. Eſay. 28.2. &amp; 49.26. Ier. 50.34. Reuel. 18.8.</p>
               <p>The truth of God is that by which hee ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth and doeth all things as they are indeed, he himſelfe being moſt free from all lying. Rom. 3.4. Deut. 7.9.</p>
               <p>The fayhfulnes of God is that by which he moſt faythfully performeth to his children that which hee hath promiſed. Eſay. 49.7. Exod. 34.6. Deut. 7.10.</p>

               <head>Hitherto we haue handled the ſimple attributes of God, which are of the firſt ſort: they of the latter ſort follow.</head>
               <p>The ſimple attributs of God, of the later ſort are thoſe which haue not in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch a ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of him, as is in ſome creatures by creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>

               <p>Eternitie, is an eſſential propertie of God, by which hee is ſayde to bee without any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning or ending. Eſa. 43.13. Pſ. 90.2. &amp; 92.8.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:22308:8"/>Infiniteneſſe, is an eſſentiall propertie of God, by which we vnderſtand that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine eſſence can in no wiſe be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in any boundes. 1. Kin. 8.27. 2. Chro. 2.6. and 6.18.</p>
               <p>It is alſo called his vnmeaſurableneſſe.</p>
               <p>Vbiquitie is an eſſentiall property of God, by which he is alwayes preſent euery where in all things. Iere. 23.23.24. Pſal. 139.7.10. Eſa. 6.3. and 66.1.</p>
               <p>It is alſo called omnipreſence.</p>
               <p>Infinitneſſe is the cauſe of vbiquitie.</p>
               <p>For that that is euery where, is therfore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where, becauſe it is infinite. Neither is, neither can any thing be ſaid to be euery where, except it be infinit.</p>
               <p>And this is proper to the Deitie alone, that it be whole euery where &amp; in euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular place.</p>
               <p>Omnipotencie, is an eſſentiall propertie of God, by which he can bring to paſſe all things, whatſoeuer he doth will now he doth will all thoſe things, which are agreable to his nature and word. Luk. 1.37. and 18.27.</p>
               <p>Omniſcience, is an eſſentiall propertie of God, by which he moſt perfectly knoweth, euen in one moment all things euery where. Hebr. 4.13.</p>
               <p>The meditation hereof hath a double vſe, one for our exhortation, the other for our comfort.</p>

               <p>By the apple of the eye is meant, that which is moſt deare to God. Deut. 32.10. Pſal. 17.8. Zach. 2.8.</p>
               <p>By the mouth is meant either the decree of Gods prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Mat. 4.4. or elſe the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement or reuealing of his word. Iere. 9.12.</p>
               <p>By the eares is meant, either readineſſe, and facilitie in hearing our prayers. Pſal. 31.3. and 34.16. Or this, that God heareth all things.</p>

                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:22308:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>By the noſe is meant the fierce wrath of God. Ierem. 49.37.</p>

               <p>By the hand is meant power, protection, liberalitie, workemanſhip, and thoſe things which are like theſe. Iob. 10.8. Pſal. 31.6. &amp; 8.7.</p>

               <p>By the hart is meant, either the liuing eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, for the hart is iudged to be the ſeate of life in a liuing creature. Geneſ. 6.6. or the decree of God, becauſe the holy Scripture doth appoint the hart to be the ſeate of the ſenſe, whoſe part is to think, &amp; to determine. Iere. 19.5. or the good pleaſure of God, as when Dauid is ſaid to be a man according to Gods owne hart.</p>
               <p>By the wombe is meant generation. Pſal. 110.3.</p>

               <p>The loue of God, is that whereby he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moued doth beſtow his gifts on his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Mal. 1.2.3. Iohn. 2. Tit. 3.4 Epheſ. 2.4.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of the grace of God.</note>The grace or mercy of God, is the fauour, good will, &amp; clemencie of God, by which he giueth freely to his elect without any deſert of theirs, all good things both for body and ſoule, eſpecially eternall life. Rom. 11.6.12.25.</p>
               <p>The ſchoolemen do make two ſorts of the grace of God: A grace making a man freely accepted, &amp; another grace giuen freely: The ſchoolemen for the moſt part do vnderſtand
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:22308:11"/>by the grace which maketh a man freely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, the gifts &amp; qualities infuſed into the ſoule: but more rightly it is taken for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, &amp; mercy of God, which doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in vs but in God himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Grace giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> freely, is euery gift which doth proceede from the loue, &amp; liberalitie of God, and is beſtowed vpon vs. Paule calleth it the gift by grace. Rom. 5.15. Schoolemen call it an infuſed grace.</p>
               <p>The good pleaſure of God, is that by which he ſuffereth all good things to pleaſe him, Gene. 1. God ſaw all things that he had made, and behold they were very good. So workes done by faith pleaſe God.</p>
               <p>The anger of God, are thoſe puniſhments, by which he puniſheth ſinnes. Rom. 1.18.</p>
               <p>And that is alſo called the reuengement of God. Eſa. 47.3. Pſal. 2.5.</p>
               <p>The furie of God, is the fierce and mighty wrath of God declared by moſt grieuous pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments. Pſal. 2.5.12.</p>
               <p>The hatred which is in God, is an abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring lothing and reiecting of euill. Mala. 1.2.3. Rom. 9.13.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of the repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of God.</note>The repenting of God, is not a changing of his diuine counſell and decree, which is immutable. 1. Sam. 15.29. but a chaunging of the workes of God. Geneſ. 6.6. 1. Sam. 15.11. Ierem. 18.8</p>

               <p>Likewiſe a ſhadow is attributed to God. Pſal. 91.1 by which is meant protection. For euen as a ſhadow doth protect vs from the beames, and heat of the ſunne: ſo God doth protect vs from daungers.</p>

               <p>There are three perſons in the Deitie, the Father, the Son, &amp; the holy ghoſt. Mat. 3.16. &amp; 28.19. 1. Iohn. 5.7. Epheſ. 2.18. Gene. 1.26. and 18.2. Exod. 3.6. and 15.16. Pſal. 33.6. Eſa. 6.3.</p>
               <p>Theſe are coeternall, and equall, of one, &amp; the ſelfe ſame ſimple eſſence, diſtinct one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another by an incommunicable proprietie. And thoſe are diſtinguiſhed one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not eſſentially, becauſe the eſſence of them is but one, yet notwithſtanding really: they differ from the eſſence of God, not in deed, but by reſpect or by relation onely.</p>
               <p>The Father, is the firſt in the Godhead, which hath begot the Sonne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euerlaſting. Pſal. 2.2. Cor. 13.</p>
               <p>The Sonne, is the ſecond in the Godhead, which is begotten of the Father, by an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall communicating of the whole eſſence. Iohn. 1.14.18.34. and 3.16. Mat. 3.17. 2. Cor. 1.19. Hoſe. 11.3. Luke. 1.31. Rom. 1.4.</p>

               <p>The Sonne, is beggotten of the eſſence of the Father: and hath the whole eſſence of the Father not by flowing from, neither by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of the Father, neither by propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (for the eſſence of the Sonne, doth not flow from the eſſence of the Father, neither is it propagated or cut out of it) but by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating. And the Sonne is not in deede the Sonne of himſelfe, becauſe he is the Sonne of the Father: yet notwithſtanding he is God of himſelfe, that is to ſay, that eſſence which is in the Sonne, is not of another, but of it ſelfe, ſeeing the eſſence of the Father, and the Sonne, is one and ſelfe ſame. The eſſence of the Father, is of it ſelfe, without all beginning: but the eſſence of the Son, is the eſſence of the Father. For the Godhead, by which the Son is God, is that ſame by which the Father is God: therefore the eſſence of the Sonne is of it ſelfe and without beginning. Therefore Chriſt is God of himſelfe. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he be God of himſelfe, he certainly can not be God at all. For that he be God, God hath it of himſelfe naturally. He cannot be God whoſe eſſence is not of it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>But it is one thing for the eſſence to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, and another thing to be begotten of the eſſence. The eſſence is not begotten of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:22308:13"/>the eſſence, the eſſence is without generation.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Sonne alſo as he is God, is not begotten. But the Son is begotten of the eſſence of the Father. Wherefore Chriſt as he is God is of himſelfe, as he is the Sonne, he is of the Father.</p>
               <p>The holy Spirit is the third perſon in the Godhead, which proceedeth from the Father and the Sonne. Iohn. 15.25.26. and 20.22. Rom. 8.9. Eſa. 6.8.9. Actes. 28.25.26. &amp; 5.3.4. 1. Cor. 3.6. and 19.20 2. Cor. 6.16.</p>

               <p>For the workes of God are now in time ſo performed, that they do fully anſwere to his decree, that is to ſay, that thoſe things which are decreed ſhould all of them be done indeed, and as they were decreed, ſo they ſhould be done.</p>

               <p>The execution of Gods decree, reſpecting this life, is that by which thoſe workes are done, which God hath decreed to doe in this life.</p>
               <p>Thoſe workes are two fold. Creation and prouidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of Creation.</note>Creation, is a worke of God, by which he hath brought forth all creatures of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Gene. 1.2.</p>

               <p>Now all the creatures of God were created very good. Therfore all nature as it is nature, is good, becauſe it is the worke of God.</p>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:22308:15"/>to the Image of God: ſome are not.</p>

               <p>Of this Image of God there are two parts, perfect reaſon, and perfect bleſſedneſſe.</p>
               <p>Perfect reaſon, is a part of Gods Image, by which the reaſonable creature, doth more expreſly carie the Image of God his creatour, whileſt by a certaine diuine force it knoweth plainlie things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out errour, as they are, and doth will and chuſe no other thing, then that which doth pleaſe God.</p>
               <p>And that perfect reaſon conſiſteth, both in the minde and in the will.</p>
               <p>Perfect reaſon in the minde, is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent vnderſtanding, rightly knowing all ſimple, particular, and generall things, which a created nature can know, and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them together, or diuiding them, or reaſoning by compared things, it hauing alſo by nature, ſome ingraffed &amp; naturall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſuch as are the principles of arts, and rule of life, and a reſpectiue motion iudging of the proper actes thereof.</p>
               <p>In the will there is both the conformitie of the will with God, and alſo free will.</p>
               <p>The conformitie of the will with God, is that obedience, which the will doth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righly performe to God, ſo that all inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:22308:16"/>deſires, and actions do agree with Gods will.</p>
               <p>The free will of a reaſonable creature, is the power of the will, chuſing or refuſing freely and of it owne proper motion, without compulſion, that which vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be choſen or refuſed.</p>

               <p>Perfect bleſſedneſſe is that other part of the image of God, by which a naturall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, through an excellent ioy, taking plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in God alone, doth enioy perfect feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie.</p>

               <p>Good Angels, are Angels which haue ſtood in their integritie in which they were made.</p>
               <p>Their free will, is to good things onely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are already ſo confirmed in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that their mind cannot be deceiued, nor erre in iudging, that is to ſay, in approuing, &amp; miſliking the obiect, neither can the will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire any other thing, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which the mind iudgeth, but chuſe that which it approueth, refuſe and reiect that which it miſliketh.

               <p>The dutie of good Angels is two fold: ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther towardes God, or men.</p>
               <p>Their dutie towards God is of two ſorts: the firſt to do Gods will. Pſal. 103.20.</p>
               <p>The ſecond to ſet forth God by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all prayſes. Pſal. 103.20. and 148.2.</p>
               <p>The dutie of Angels towardes men, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo two fold.</p>
               <p>The one, to be a defence to the elect againſt all dangers, and againſt the ſubtleties and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults of the enemies, and to cary the ſoules of the elect being dead, into the place of the bleſſed. Or elſe to miniſter to thoſe that feare God in all their wayes. Heb. 1.14. Pſal. 34.8. &amp; 103.21. Mat. 18.10. Pſal. 91.11. Dan. 10. and 12. Luke. 16.22.</p>
               <p>Their other dutie is, to puniſh the euill. For the good Angels, are not onely the diſpoſers of the goodneſſe of God, but alſo ſometime executers of puniſhment. 2. King. 29.35.</p>

               <head>Hitherto concerning good Angels: now concerning euill Angels.</head>
               <p>Euill Angels, are Angels who haue fallen from God. Iohn. 8.44. 2. Pet. 2.4. Epiſtle of Iude. 5.6. Epheſ. 2.2.</p>
               <p>The ſame are called deuils.</p>
               <p>And they are the firſt authors of all ſins, &amp; do endeuour to ſeduce men by their temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and to ſtirre them vp to ſin, as alſo by
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:22308:17"/>all meanes to turne them away from God, &amp; to thruſt them headlong into deſtruction.</p>
               <p>The temptations of the deuill, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, ſollicitings, and ſturrings vp, by which he doth endeuour to draw men into ſinne and deſtruction. After this manner he tempted our firſt parents. Geneſ. 3.1. So the deuill tempting Chriſt, ſollicited him to diſtruſt concerning Gods prouidence, as though God could not ſuſtaine, and preſerue him without bread. Mat. 4.3. he tempted him to raſhneſſe, and vnaduiſed boldneſſe, that for the obtaining of glory, he might expoſe himſelfe to vnneceſſary daungers. verſ. 6. he ſollicited him to idolatry. verſ. 8.</p>
               <p>In euill Angels, we muſt conſider both their office, and reſtraint.</p>
               <p>If we reſpect their office, they are compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to ſerue, and obey God in thoſe workes, which it pleaſeth God to performe by them.</p>
               <p>Of this office there are two parts: For they are ordained both to afflict the godly, that their conſtancy might be proued. Iob. 1.12. and 2.6.7. 2. Corin. 22.7. as alſo to vexe the wicked, as officers, and tormentours ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God.</p>
               <p>The reſtraint of the euill Angels, is the bounding, and limiting of their power and fury, that they are able to do no more, then God doth ſuffer them to do.</p>
               <p>Their free will is to euill things onely. For ſeeing they are caſt away from God for euer,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:22308:17"/>&amp; are hardened in euill, they can do nothing, nor hereafter ſhall do any thing but ſin, that is to ſay, onely to approue with their minde, and chuſe with their will, thoſe things which are euill, and diſpleaſe God, and therefore they ſhall ſuffer euerlaſting puniſhment.

               <p>Neither doth any thing happen raſhly, or by chance, but all things are done by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of God, according to his fatherly counſell and will.</p>

               <p>Both good and euill is gouerned by the prouidence of God.</p>
               <p>Good is that which God alloweth,<note place="margin">Of good.</note> as for example, all the ſubſtances of things, &amp; their quantities and qualities, which they haue by creation, their motions, and changes, their actions and euents as farre forth as they are motions, and do agree with Gods nature and will, as it is expreſſed in his word.</p>
               <p>Whatſoeuer therefore is remaining either in deuils or in men by creation, is good.</p>
               <p>Good is either naturall, or morall.</p>
               <p>Naturall good, is euery good thing which
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:22308:20"/>God hath created in nature, to thoſe vſes of men which pleaſe God, as the ſunne, moone, the earth, the water, meat, drinke &amp; rayment.</p>
               <p>Morall good, is an action agreeing with the eternall, and vnchangeable wiſedome of God, manifeſted in Gods law, which both by creation is ingraffed in the mindes of men, and afterwardes publiſhed abroad by Gods voyce.

               <p>The actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God done without meanes, is
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:22308:26"/>that whereby God doth performe without meanes or inſtruments, whatſoeuer he will. Gene. 20.3. Mat. 4.4. Deut. 8.3. So Gene. 2.5. When as yet the Lord had not rayned on the earth, neither was there any man to till the ground, yet all things were greene, and flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the field, and there were fruites in the fields.</p>
               <p>Hereby we learne that God can eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meanes, performe and bring foorth all things.</p>
               <p>Neither yet doth it follow thereupon that the earth is not to be tilled, becauſe God without meanes can bring forth of the earth all things, that is to ſay, although it rayne not, although the earth be not tilled. Becauſe God afterward ordained meanes by which he would worke. Now we muſt vſe theſe meanes or elſe we ſhould tempt God.</p>
               <p>Yea God would haue man to labour euen in the ſtate of his integrity, namely that he might till and dreſſe the garden Eden. Gene. 2.15.</p>

               <p>He ſuffereth the Saints to fall into ſin, that they being chaſtened for their ſinne, he might bring them to the true knowledge of them ſelues, and to humility, Pſal. 119.</p>

               <p>For God would not being good, ſuffer any thing to be done euilly, except alſo he being omnipotent, could turne euill to good.</p>

               <p>A ſtrange God, is euery thing, in which a man putteth his confidence beſides the true God, or that which a man doth feare or loue more then God, or equally with God, or to which he giueth diuine worſhip contrary to the expreſſe word of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:22308:33"/>To haue ſtrange Gods, is to put his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in any thing, which is not the true God, or to loue, or feare that more then God, or as well as God, or to giue to it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine worſhip contrary to the expreſſe word of God.</p>
               <p>Not to haue ſtrange Gods before God, is to eſchew all idolatry, not onely in the ſight of men, but euen in the heart, becauſe God ſeeth all things.</p>
               <p>The ſecond commandement is this:<note place="margin">The <hi>2.</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</note> thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelf any grauen image, neither ſhalt thou counterfeit any Image of thoſe things, which are in heauen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, or in the earth beneath, or in the waters vnder the earth, thou ſhalt not bow downe to them, nor worſhip them. For I am the Lord thy God, ſtrong, iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, reuenging the ſinnes of the fathers vpon the children, and that vnto the third and fourth generation of thoſe that hate me: and ſhewing mercy vnto thouſandes of them that loue me and keepe my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</p>
               <p>In this commandement God forbiddeth, both the framing of Images for Religions ſake, and alſo the worſhipping of them.</p>

               <p>And that is either confirmed by an oth, or elſe it is without an oth.</p>
               <p>The oth of God, is a confirming of the foreſhewing of things to come, not becauſe that foreſhewing is doubtfull, but becauſe God would ſo prouide for our infirmity, iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of God according to the maner of men, that if any bee not contented with the bare wordes of God, the othes might ſuffice him.</p>

               <p>The bare foretelling, is that which hath no oth adioyned to it, but yet it is as certain as if God that had ſworne, had done it. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Philo ſayd elega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, all the words of God are othes, in reſpect of their certaintie, neither do they need any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as whoſe truth proueth and defendeth it by the effectes, as the ſhining of the natiue light being ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t forth.</p>
               <p>Againe the foretelling of things to come, is either abſolute, or with a condition.</p>
               <p>The abſolute foretelling is that which is without all condition, and that is prophecie or foretelling.</p>
               <p>A prophecie or foretelling, is a reuealing of miſteries or ſecret things which ſhall come to paſſe in their due time. Such were

               <p>That ſame is alſo called ſanctification, and the gift of grace. Rom. 5. Alſo of ſchoolemen it is called an infuſed grace.</p>

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:22308:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>the former belongeth to this life, the later to the life to come.</p>
               <p>In regeneration are to be conſidered both the partes, and alſo the perpetuall adioynts.</p>

The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightening belongeth to the vnderſtanding, and repentance belongeth to the will.

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:22308:63"/>it ſelfe vnto the ſenſes, which putteth men in minde of ſome other thing, which is ioyned with that ſigne.</p>
               <p>A ſigne is either naturall or giuen.</p>
               <p>A naturall ſigne is a ſigne which by nature hath that ſelfe ſame thing in it which it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth. Of this ſort is the rainebow, ſignifying either ſhowres or faire weather, if it be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered naturally.</p>
               <p>A ſigne giuen, is a ſigne, which doth not by nature ſignifie that whereof it is a ſigne, but it ſignifieth by the appointment and will of God: as the rainebow is a ſigne by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God, that the world ſhall not periſh with a flood.</p>
               <p>The ſigne giuen, is either a miracle or a Sacrament.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of miracles.</note>A miracle is a ſigne effected beyond the order of nature. Exod. 3.2. and 14.21.22.23. Dan. 34.9. and 6.22. Mat. 14.19.20.</p>
               <p>Therefore if any thing be done according to the order and courſe of nature, it is not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous, but naturall.</p>
               <p>There are two endes of miracles: the one, that God by them might manifeſtly ſhew forth his power. Exodus 19. and 20. Dan. 3.</p>
               <p>The other, that by them as by ſeales, he might confirme true doctrine. Mat. 16.17.</p>
               <p>It is true indeed that in miracles the order of nature by the ouerruling power of God is interrupted, but neuer deſtroyed or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:22308:63"/>throwen, neither are the eſſences of thoſe things deſtroyed, although the forme be ſometime chaunged. So when the Sunne ſtood while Ioſhua fought, when it retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned backe when Ezekiah was ſicke, the order of nature was interrupted, not ouerthrowen: for afterward the Sunne kept the ſame courſe againe, which was giuen to it in the creation. Yet neuer theleſſe the eſſence of the Sunne remained. When the ſea was deuided, the courſe of the ſea was interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: but the worke being firnſhed which God had decreed, it returned againe to the former courſe, and continued the ſame: yea the very eſſence of the ſea remained. When Aarons rod was made a Serpent, it was not the taking away of the ſubſtance, but a changing of it. So the water in Cana of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lile, the ſubſtance was not taken away, but it was turned into wine.</p>
               <p>Now God worketh moſt freely in the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of miracles: for be himſelfe hath moſt freely put that order into nature, therefore alſo whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he will he can moſt freely interrupt it. Furthermore becauſe he is not bound to the order of nature, he may interrupt it as it pleaſeth him.</p>
               <p>And although God can doe all things, yet muſt not miracles be euery where alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, eſpecially where men cannot be well aſſured of Gods will, neither yet where no neceſſitie is: as for example, in the holie
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:22308:64"/>Supper men may not imagine miracles, as though the body of Chriſt were ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and miraculouſly in the bread: becauſe Chriſt hath no where ſaid that he would haue it ſo. No where, I ſay, hath he ſayd, that he would be in the bread. Furthermore it is not of neceſſity: for Chriſt may become ours, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not into the bread, or with the bread to be thruſt into our mouthes.</p>

               <p>Or elſe, the Sacrament of the couenant of grace is a Sacrament by which the faithfull are both admoniſhed, and alſo are made ſure that the couenant of grace, and all the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites of God which are promiſed in this coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, doe not onely belong to others, but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerally to euery one of them, who doe vſe the Sacrament according to Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>

                  <note place="margin">A miſterie.</note>It is alſo called a Myſterie, becauſe it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth ſecret thinges, and ſuch as are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to them who haue not beene taught out of the worde of God concerning the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification and vſe of them: becauſe in a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie one thinge is ſeene, and an other is meant.</p>
               <p>The Vbiquitaries doe thinke it therefore to be called a myſtery, becauſe the manner
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:22308:65"/>of the bodily receiuing of it is vnſearchable: but this is a falſe cauſe, becauſe the bodily receiuing hath no foundation in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but it is the deuiſe and imagination of men. Furthermore, this manner is manifeſted to vs, namely that it is ſpirituall, and that the receiuing is done by faith.</p>
               <p>Both the Word and Sacraments doe lead our faith to Chriſt, as to the only foundation of our ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Therefore in the Sacraments is propeun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, offered, giuen and ſealed, no other thing then is promiſed and preached in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, but one and the ſelfe ſame thing, namely, Chriſt with his benefites. In the Sacraments we receiue no other thing, then in the ſimple worde, namely Chriſt with his benefites.</p>
               <p>And the receiuing of Chriſt, whether it be in the ſimple worde, as in Iohn. 6. or in the Sacraments, is one and the ſelfe ſame, to wit, ſpirituall, that is to ſay, which is wrought in vs by the power of the holy ſpirite, and by the onely inſtrument of faith. The recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of Chriſt in the worde and Sacramentes doe not differ indeede: for in both there is the ſame thing and the ſame ſubſtance, to wit, Chriſt with his benefites. It doth not differ in the manner, for it is ſpirituall in them both. The difference is not in the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by which wee receiue it, for in them
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:22308:65"/>both faith is the inſtrument to receiue it by. What then is the difference betweene the receiuing of Chriſt in the ſimple worde, and in the Sacraments? The outwarde forme onely: to wit, becauſe in the Sacraments bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſignes are ioyned with the word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. In the ſimple worde God dealeth with vs by preaching, and by our eares onely: but in the Sacramentes he vſeth beſide, ſuch ſignes as offer themſelues to the reſt of the ſenſes alſo: whereby it commeth to paſſe, that the communicating of Chriſt by the Sacraments, is more forcible and plaine, then by the ſimple word only.</p>
               <p>There are two partes of the Sacrament of the couenaunt of grace: namely the earthly matter, and the outwarde action, or the outwarde rite. Geneſ. 17.11. Exod. 12.8. and ſo forwarde. Matth. 3.11. and 28.9. Matth. 26.26. and ſo forward. 1. Cor. 11.23.24.25.</p>
               <p>The earthly matter alone, is not a perfect and whole Sacrament, but there muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned to it the outwarde action or ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, or the vſe of the earthly matter appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>For nothing hath the force of a Sacrament, except there be adioyned to it the vſe of it, according to Chriſtes inſtitution.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of the earthly matter.</note>The earthly matter in the Sacrament, is a ſigne or token, by which vnder a certaine
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:22308:66"/>promiſed ſimilitude, a heauenly matter is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified and repreſented to the faithfull, that ſo they might bee aſſured, that the heauenly matter is as certaine ſpiritually preſent, as they doe certainely ſee the earthly matter, to be bodily preſent before their eies. Gen. 17.11. Rom 4 11. Eze. 36 25.</p>
               <p>Chriſt himſelfe by the holy ſpirite, doth make the thinges promiſed preſent to our faith: and faith receiueth them.</p>
               <p>Faith worketh not that preſence: but Chriſt himſelfe worketh it.</p>
               <p>The heauenly matter ſignified in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament by the earthly matter, is the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament or couenant of grace, in the bloud of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Therefore we muſt not reſpect the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter and earthly elements, but turne the eyes of our fayth to the thinges promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall metaphor.</note>Wherefore alſo the earthly matter by a manner of ſpeaking, both vſuall in the Scripture and Church, and alſo plaine in it ſelfe, is alſo oft-times called by the name of the heauenly matter: becauſe the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly matter is ſignified and meant by the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Exod. 24.8. The bloud of the ſacrifices is called the bloud of the couenant. Geneſ. 17.10. Circumciſion is called the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Exod. 12.11. The Paſchall Lambe is called the Paſſeouer. Titus 3.5. Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:22308:66"/>is called the waſhing of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Now howe theſe ſpeeches concerning the Sacramentes ought to be vnderſtoode and expounded, the Scripture it ſelfe doeth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, becauſe the earthly matter is a ſigne of the couenant. Geneſ. 17.11. Becauſe it is a ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of fayth. Rom. 4.11. Becauſe it is a remembrance of Chriſtes death.</p>
               <p>And it is ſo called by a metaphor, in which the ſigne is eyther put for the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, or is called by the name of the thing ſignified.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward action in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>The outward action in a Sacrament, that is to ſay, a rite or ceremonie which we muſt obſerue in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t according to the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution Chriſt, is a ſigne of the inward action. Deut. 30.6. Matth. 3.11. Rom. 6.3. 1. Cor. 6.11. Col. 2.11. Act. 22.16.</p>
               <p>This action is two fold: one of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter adminiſtring the Sacrament, the other of a faythfull man vſing a Sacrament.</p>
               <p>The action of the Miniſter adminiſtring the Sacrament is two folde: the ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the earthly matter: and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:22308:67"/>of the ſame earthly matter?</p>
               <p>The ſanctifying of the earthly matter, is an action of the miniſter, in the which by Gods commaundement, hee appointeth the earthly matter to a holy vſe.</p>
               <p>Therefore the rehearſing of the wordes of the inſtitution of the Sacrament is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, both that the manner of inſtituting the Sacrament may bee layde open, as alſo that by it the earthly matter may bee ſanctified and conſecrated to a holy vſe, becauſe therein the commaundement of God is contayned. Therefore Auguſtine ſayth; The worde commeth to the element, and ſo there is a Sacrament. 1. Corinth. 11.23.24.25.</p>
               <p>The adminiſtring of the earthly matter, is the other action of the miniſter, whereby is meant, that God doth as certainely offer and giue the benefites that he hath promiſed, as we do certainely ſee that the earthly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is offered and giuen vs by the miniſter of the word. 1. Cor. 11.23.</p>
               <p>The miniſter of the worde diſtributeth and offereth the earthly matter: but Chriſt himſelfe diſtributeth and offereth the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly matter. Matth. 3.11. I baptize you with water, there is an other who baptizeth with the holy ſpirite.</p>

               <head>Hitherto concerning the action of the miniſter that adminiſtreth the Sacrament.</head>
               <p>The action of a faithfull man vſing a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is alſo two folde: namely, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of the earthly matter, and thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing.</p>
               <p>The receiuing of the earthly matter, is the action of a faithfull man vſing the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, whereby he receiueth the earthly matter, to ſignifie that he doth ſo certainely receiue ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually the benefits that God hath promiſed, as he doth certainly receiue bodily the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly matter. Rom. 4.11. Matth. 26.26.</p>
               <p>We receiue the worde of the promiſe of grace, and the earthly matter from the mouth and hand of the miniſter: but we receiue the heauenly matters from the hande of Chriſt himſelfe.</p>
               <p>The outward receiuing is wrought in the body: the inward is only wrought by faith &amp; by the powerfull working of the holy ſpirit in our harts: for the inward receiuing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth iuſtification and regeneration.</p>
               <p>We receiue the earthly matter by the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that is to ſay, by the members, actions, &amp; ſenſes of the body, by the eies, eares, handes, mouth &amp; ſtomacke, ſight, hearing, touching, taſt, and ſmell: but we receiue the heauenly matters by faith, and the powerfull working of the holy ſpirite in our hearts.</p>
               <p>And therefore not onely the faithfull,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:22308:68"/>but euen infidels receiue the earthly matter: but the faithfull onely receiue the heauenly matter.</p>
               <p>Thankeſgiuing is the action of a faithfull man vſing the Sacraments, whereby he with his mouth and heart giueth thanks to Chriſt, for the whole worke and benefite of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. 1. Cor. 11.25.26.</p>
               <p>Theſe therefore are the partes of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which are required to the perfecting of euery Sacrament, by which the couenant of grace is ſealed vp: with which if in the true vſe thereof, the heauenly matters and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde action be ioyned together, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction is called a Sacramentall vnion, which is alſo the cauſe of the ſpeeches proper to a Sacrament.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall vnion.</note>Therefore the Sacramentall vnion, is a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ioyning together of the Sacrament, with thoſe things whereof it is a Sacrament, or elſe it is a ioyning together of the ſignes and things, that is to ſay, of the earthly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with the heauenly, and of the outwarde action with the inward action.</p>
               <p>This vnion is not naturall and locall, but ſpirituall and belonging to couenants, and hauing reſpect to others, which is in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine diſpoſing of the ſigne to the thing it ſelfe: and in the ſpirituall offering and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of things truely ioyned with the bodily offering and receiuing of ſignes.</p>
               <p>As therfore there are two parts of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:22308:68"/>ſo alſo of the ſacramentall vnion.</p>
               <p>The firſt part, is the vniting of the earthly matter with the heauenly.</p>
               <p>It is not neceſſary, that this heauenly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, be ſubſtantially and bodily in the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly matter, or in that place in which the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly matter is, becauſe this vnion is meerly ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall.</p>
               <p>Neither doth it follow, if Chriſt be not bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily preſent on the earth in the earthly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or in the place in which the earthly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is, that therefore he is not preſent, becauſe that indeede is truly preſent which is preſent ſpiritually.</p>
               <p>The other part of the ſacramentall vnion, is the ioyning together of the outward action with the inward action.</p>
               <p>For in the right vſe of the Sacrament, the offering and receiuing of the ſigne and thing ſignified is ioyned together: the offering, &amp; receiuing of the ſign indeede is bodily, by the hand of the miniſter: but the offering and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of the thing ſignified, is ſpirituall, through true faith by the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p>For a Sacrament, is not onely an earthly, and bodily action, but a heauenly and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall action alſo, in which not only the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly matter, which is on earth, but alſo thoſe things which are in heauen, which are in God, and which are in the hearts of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, are preſent with vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:22308:69"/>And the holy ſpirit ioyning vs together with Chriſt, doth couple vs, euen we being moſt farre aſunder, as in regard of diſtance of place, much more nearly and ſtraightly, then either the ſoul is ioyned with the body, or the vine with the braunches.</p>

               <p>Of Baptiſme there are two parts: the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Baptiſme, and the outward action in Baptiſme.</p>
               <p>By the water of Baptiſme is ſignified, the bloud of Chriſt ſhed on the croſſe. Heb. 12.24. 1. Pet. 1.1. Zach. 13.1. Ezec. 36.25.</p>
               <p>The outward action in Baptiſme is two fold: the one of the miniſter adminiſtring Baptiſme: the other of a faithfull man vſing Baptiſme. The action of the miniſter is two fold: the ſanctification of the water, and the outward waſhing.</p>
               <p>The ſanctification of the water, is the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing of it to this end, that it might ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the bloud of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The outward waſhing is a ſigne, ſeale, and very ſure pledge of the inward waſhing, whereby we with the bloud of Chriſt are waſhed from ſins. Reue. 1.5. Rom. 6.3. 1. Cor. 1.6.11. 1. Pet. 3.21. Eph. 5.26. 1. Ioh. 1.7.</p>

               <p>Therefore the outward Baptiſme is called the waſhing of regeneration. Tit. 3.5. The waſhing away of ſinnes. Acts 22.16. not becauſe the waſhing is properly and by it ſelfe that by which we are regenerated: for we are properly regenerated by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirite: but becauſe it is the ſigne and ſeale of the inward waſhing, that is to ſay, of regeneration and adoption according to the forme of the couenant; I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeede.

               <p>To be waſhed with the bloud of Chriſt, is is to be made partakers of the benefites of the

               <p>Therefore thou doeſt come to the banket of Chriſt, thou art his gueſt, as oft as thou doeſt eat and drinke of this ſupper.</p>
               <p>The Lords ſupper commeth in the roome of the Paſchall Lambe: therefore it doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo keepe the analogie or proportion thereof. For both the one and the other is a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of nouriſhment and ſpirituall bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp.</p>
               <p>And as the eating of the Paſchall Lambe was often vſed: ſo alſo the vſing of the Lords
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:22308:75"/>Supper is oftentimes performed.</p>
               <p>For as the Paſſeouer was the nouriſhing of Iudaiſme: ſo the Lords Supper is the nouriſhing of Chriſtianity, which nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing often times ſtandeth in neede of meat and drinke, that is to ſay, reſtoring and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing, euen as our life doth daily want refreſhing, which is performed by meat and drinke.</p>
               <p>The parts of the Lords Supper, as of other ſacraments, are two: the earthly matter, and outward action in the Supper.</p>
               <p>The earthly matter in the Supper is two fold: the bread and the wine. Becauſe we liue not only by meat, but by drinke alſo.</p>
               <p>The bread in the holy Supper is a ſigne or image of Chriſts body giuen to death for vs. Ioh. 6.35.48.50.51.55.56.</p>
               <p>The wine in the holy Supper is a ſigne or image of Chriſts bloud, ſhed on the croſſe for vs.</p>
               <p>Therefore the bread alſo is called the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy it ſelfe, and the wine, or cup in which the wine is, is called the bloud it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Not that the body of Chriſt deſcendeth from the ſeate of his glory, out of heauen, and doth hide it ſelfe inuiſibly in the bread, and his bloud in the wine, which opinion is moſt abſurd: but therefore the bread is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the body of Chriſt, becauſe it is a ſigne, remembrance, token, figure, ſimilitude,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:22308:76"/>and image of his body giuen for vs. And the wine or cup is called the new Teſtament or couenant, in the bloud of Chriſt: becauſe it is a ſigne of the new Teſtament or coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt, that is to ſay, of reconciliation wrought with God, by the bloud of Chriſt ſhed vppon the Croſſe for the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes. The bread by a metaphor, is called the body of Chriſt deliuered for vs, becauſe the bread being broken, is a ſigne calling into our remembraunce, or imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in vs, and as it were ſetting before our eyes, the breaking, that is to ſay, the cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the body of Chriſt. The wine by the ſame metaphor, is the bloud of Chriſt, becauſe it is a ſigne calling into our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and imprinting in vs, the ſhedding of Chriſts bloud done on the croſſe, for the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Yea the bread is not a ſigne of his glorious body, as it is now already glorified, but of his body deliuered vnto death, of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy broken on the croſſe, and ſlayne for our ſakes: as the Lord expreſly ſayth; This is my body which is giuen for you.</p>
               <p>And the wine is not a ſigne of his bloud contayned in the veines, but of his bloud ſhed on the Croſſe, or as it was ſhed: as the ſame Lord expreſly teſtifieth.</p>
               <p>And therefore the body of Chriſt is not now in the bread, becauſe it is already glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:22308:76"/>and ſhall not before the laſt day deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend from heauen vnto this miſerable earth, neyther is his bloud already in the wine: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he once ſhed his bloud, and died, now he ſheddeth it no more, death ſhall no more raigne ouer him.</p>
               <p>By the bread being broken is repreſented vnto vs, as by a ſimilitude, &amp; a certaine image, his body that ſuffered for vs. For the whole action of the Lords Supper is to be referred to this end, that we might preach the death of the Lord vntill he come.</p>
               <p>The metaphor ſeemeth to be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient in the laying open of theſe wordes, becauſe not the bread ſimply, but the bread broken, by a certaine ſimilitude, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the body broken, as Paul ſayeth: that is to ſay, deliuered vnto death. For the breaking of the bread, putteth vs in mind of the breaking of the body of Chriſt, as it were by a certaine picture ſet before our eyes. Chriſt did not ſimply call the bread his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but the bread which is broken. But to what end? As I ſee with mine eyes that the bread is broken for me: ſo I am certainely confirmed in my faith, that the body of Chriſt was giuen vnto death for me. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as certainely as the miniſter of the word doth giue me the bread broken, ſo certainely doth Chriſt giue me his body deliuered to death for my ſake.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:22308:77"/>That this is the naturall meaning of the words of Chriſt, by this it appeareth.</p>
               <p>For Chriſt commaundeth to doe all theſe things in remembraunce of him, and Paul expoundeth that ſaying, yee ſhall preach the death of the Lord vntill he come.</p>
               <p>Chriſt truely hath not ſaid, the bread is the ſigne of my body: but becauſe he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned the Sacrament, he ſpeaketh of it as the Scripture is alwayes wont to ſpeake con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Sacraments, vnder a metaphor, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the ſigne by the name of the thing ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnified.</p>
               <p>And therefore the faithfull comming to the holy Supper, when they behold with the eyes of the body the Sacramentall bread, they are admoniſhed, that withall, by the eyes of faith they behold and embrace the body of Chriſt, broken or crucified vppon the croſſe for vs. For therefore the bread hath the name of the body, not that the faithfull ſhould ſtand vppon the bread one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or ſeeke the body of Chriſt in the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Element, but that they ſhould by faith lift vp themſelues into Heauen, whither he did aſcend, and where he is, and by the eyes of faith ſhould behold, and eate the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted Lambe that was ſlaine for them on the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly Altar, the Church nameth it, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Lift vp your hearts.</p>
               <p>By the ſame metaphor the bread which
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:22308:77"/>we breake, is by Paul called the communion of the body of Chriſt, the cuppe of bleſſing which we bleſſe is called the communion of the bloud of Chriſt. 1. Cor. 10.16. Becauſe by this bread and cup, as by a ſeale, the faithfull are aſſured that they haue communion, that is to ſay, fellowſhip with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Both the matters, that is to ſay, the earthly and heauenly, are indeede preſent in the holy Supper: the former indeede bodily and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, but the other ſpiritually, &amp; by the ſight which faith affordeth vs.</p>

               <p>Otherwiſe if they were abſent, how could it be made the partaking of the body and bloud of Chriſt, for the partaking is not of things that are abſent, but preſent.</p>
               <p>But the body and bloud of Chriſt, are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſent to the faithfull, that is to ſay, to thoſe who receiue it by faith, and yet this is by a ſpirituall preſence, not by a locall, or bodily preſence or placing: by a Sacramental preſence, and ſuch as belongeth to a couenant

               <p>The inward preparation is ſpiritual, which conſiſteth in a mans examining of himſelfe, or in trying his owne worthineſſe or vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe.</p>
               <p>The worthineſſe and vnworthineſſe of thoſe who come to the holy Supper, and the effects of them both are two folde: either of the perſon or of the vſing.</p>
               <p>The worthines of the perſon is faith, or the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt imputed by fayth, which whoſoeuer hath, they are worthy gueſts, &amp; receiue this food to eternal ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>Therfore the worthines of the perſon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in faith alone, and the effect of it is the eſcaping of eternall puniſhment.</p>
               <p>The vnworthines of a perſon is infidelity,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:22308:80"/>wherewith whoſoeuer are poſſeſſed, they are vnworthy of this table, and receiue to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues iudgement and eternall damnation.</p>
               <p>The worthineſſe of the vſing is true reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, inward and outward, forgiuenes, loue, a ſerious bewayling of ſinnes repentance, the meditation of the benefites of Chriſt, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning of the body of the Lord, thankeſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, the auoyding of all offences.</p>
               <p>Nowe the worthineſſe hath place in the faithfull onely.</p>
               <p>The vnworthines of the vſing, is the vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerent or irreligious offering of the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p>The ſame indeede is alwaies in perſons which are vnworthy, yet ſometime euen in the worthy partakers.</p>
               <p>And therefore it is two folde: one in the wicked, the other in the godly.</p>
               <p>The vnworthines of the vſing in the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, is a want &amp; abſence of true reuerence, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward &amp; outward, of forgiuenes, of loue, of a ſerious bewailing of ſins, &amp; of repentance, of the meditation of the benefites of Chriſt, of thankeſgiuing, of the diſcerning of the body of the Lord, &amp; of the auoiding of all offences.</p>
               <p>The vnworthines of the vſing in the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is a negligence and colder feeling in the trying of himſelfe.</p>
               <p>For although the godly doe indeede eate the bread of the Lorde, and the bread which is the Lorde, and therefore eate eternall
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:22308:81"/>ſaluation, free from eternall iudgement, yet they comming vnreuerently to the Lordes Table, that is to ſay, trying themſelues too negligently and coldly, doe eate to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues temporall iudgement, that is to ſay, they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend God, and are by diuers chaſtiſements in this life called backe to the amending of theſe ſinnes. So Paul doth with a threatning of temporall puniſhment terrifie the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, comming vnreuerently to the Lords Table, although ſome of them notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding being truely conuerted: and yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe he rayſeth them vp againe with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation. 1. Cor. 11.30.31.32.</p>
               <p>For euen the faithfull do oftentimes ſinne by this kind of negligence and careleſſeneſſe: and although their eternall ſaluation be not made fruſtrate, yet they are hardly chaſtened in this life. The Apoſtle teacheth this plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when the Corinthians ſinning in the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious vſing of the Lords Supper, whether by affections or by ignorance, doth yet call them brethren, and doth ſay that they are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed of the Lord with diſeaſes, and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall death for this fault, that they might not be condemned with this world. 1. Cor. 11.30.31.32. as 1. Cor. 3.12. hee ſayth; Thoſe which build haye and ſtubble on that foundation, which is Chriſt, they ſhall indeede be ſaued, but yet as it were by fire.</p>
               <p>In all the faithfull indeede there is ſome parcel of this vnworthines, but in ſome more,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:22308:81"/>in ſome leſſe: and thoſe who haue care to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde it, &amp; keepe a good conſcience, are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned for Chriſts ſake.</p>
               <p>And therefore there is required a tryall of both theſe ſorts of worthines: that wee may eſcape not onely the eternall, but the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary wrath and puniſhment of God. 1. Cor. 11.28.</p>

               <p>The trying or examining of a mans ſelfe conſiſteth in two things: firſt whether thou be in the faith, whether thou vnderſtand the articles of fayth, the promiſe of the Goſpell, and doctrine of the Sacraments.

               <p>It is of Paul called the ſpirituall body: then not a ſpirite, for the ſpirite hath not a bodie, that is to ſay, fleſh &amp; bones.

And Paul doth not ſay that the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhalbe changed in the reſurrection, but the qualities of the body and ſubſtance: for ſo he writeth to the Corinthians, that this body which is ſubiect to corruption, may put on an incorruptible nature, &amp; the mortall may put on immortality.

You except: but we ſhall be like the Angels; then we ſhall not be Angels: for our fleſh muſt riſe againe, and we in the ſame (as Iob ſayth) ſhall ſee God our Sauiour. If our bodies ſhall be changed into ſpirites: then man ſhall not riſe againe, becauſe man conſiſteth of bodie and ſoule, and the bodie cannot paſſe into the ſpirite, for they do not agree in matter. By Paul a ſpirituall body is oppoſed to a naturall body, but vnderſtande by a naturall body, a changeable and weake bodie: for our bodie ceaſeth not to be a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall body, although it be made immortall and impaſſible; for euen the heauen is a naturall body, which yet co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth of a nature not paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible nor vaniſhing.</p>

               <p>The particular Church, is either of the old Teſtament, or of the new. Eph. 2.17.</p>
               <p>The Church of the old Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was that which was among the people of God, before the comming of Chriſt. Eph. 2.11.12.</p>

               <p>And they are either ordinary or extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary. 1. Cor. 12.28.29.31. The office of the

               <p>Ordinary miniſters are thoſe, who do em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their ordinary labor on the church, both by an ordinary maner, and alſo endued with ordinary gifts. Rom. 12.6. 1. Cor. 12.4.</p>

               <p>Thoſe that were called extraordinarily had this teſtimony, that they could not erre in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, becauſe God did teſtifie concerning it. Yet in life and manners, both they might ſin, and ſometime alſo haue ſinned. Gal. 2.14.</p>
               <p>Miniſters that were extraordinarily called, had extraordinary gifts, namely, extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary prophecies, and the giftes of working miracles. 1. Cor. 12.9.10.</p>
               <p>An extraordinary prophecy was that, by which through the ſingular gift of God, they were enabled both to interpret and apply Scriptures: and alſo moſt ſurely and clearely to foretell things to come. Ioh. 10.8.12.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE ſecond part of the word of God, is concerning good workes, that is to ſay, which preſcribeth and commandeth what works are to be done by the faithfull, that ſo men may performe thankefulnes due to God, for the deliuerance from ſin and eternall death. Phil. 1.27. Iam. 2.20. Tit. 3.8.</p>
               <p>Good workes are workes commanded by God, which are done of a true faith, to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God alone. Rom. 14.13. Heb. 11.6.</p>
               <p>And yet they are before God neither righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes it ſelfe nor any part of righteouſnes, neither haue they any whit of merit in them. Eſa. 64.6. Rom 3.28. Epheſ 2.8.9. Luk. 17.10.</p>
               <p>Euery ſingular good worke hath two ſins ſet againſt it: the one as diſagreeing, the other as contrarie.</p>
               <p>

                  <note place="margin">Of hypocriſie.</note>The former of them is hypocriſie, that is to ſay, a fayning of godlineſſe and honeſty, or if you will, a new found godlineſſe, the workes whereof doe ſeeme to haue ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity and agreement with good workes: and therefore they doe oftentimes delude men with a ſhew and neareneſſe of goodneſſe: but in very deede are diuerſe from them, eyther becauſe they are not commaunded by God, but are fayned and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded by men, vnder the opinion of vprightnes: or although they are commanded by God, yet they are done of hypocriſie either to deceiue others, or for the ſhewe of godlines, after the manner of the Phariſes. Although ſometime there may be more differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces or diſagreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts then one.</p>
               <p>But the ſinne which is oppoſed to a good work as contrary therto, is that which is ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply contrary to it.</p>
               <p>And euen as the ſumme of our faith is comprehended in the Creed of the Apoſtles, ſo the law of God is the direction and rule of good workes.</p>
               <p>Both the adioints and alſo the kindes of good workes are to be conſidered.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of the adioynts of good works.</note>The adioynts of good works are two fold: ſome if we reſpect God, and ſome if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect men.</p>
               <p>If we reſpect God they are two fold, that is, the childlike feare of God, and ſubiection that we owe to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of the childlike feare of God.</note>The childlike feare of God, is a feare of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:22308:97"/>the anger and iudgement of God againſt ſin, whereby we are ſtirred vp reuerently to obey God and flie ſinne. Or elſe the childlike feare of God, is that whereby we feare, as the chiefeſt euill of all, leaſt we diſpleaſe God through diſobedience. Pſal. 5.8. Such a feare is in the elect, and it conſiſteth in three things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that we ſet before our eyes God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes beholding all our workes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that we acknowledge and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence him as the witneſſe and reuenger of all our thoughts, words, and workes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that there be nothing which we feare more then to offende God, being ſo louing a father, and to ſtirre vp his anger and iudgement againſt vs.</p>
               <p>Againſt this feare of God is oppoſed, both a cauſeleſſe feare, and the ſeruile or ſlauiſh feare of God, &amp; alſo ſecurity or careleſnes: the two former as diſperate or diſagreeing, the other as contrary.</p>
               <p>A cauſeles feare is to feare where no feare is. Pſal. 14. This is an hypocriticall feare, as is that alſo of the Papiſts, who feare the wrath of God, when they breake fooliſh traditions, as when they will not eate fleſh on daies forbidden by the Biſhop of Rome, and doe not feare the anger of God, when they doe ſtiffely and ſtubburnly defend Idolatry, &amp; do perſecute godly men and innocentes with ſword and fire.</p>
               <p>The ſeruile feare of God, is the feare of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:22308:98"/>Gods wrath, and deuine iudgement againſt ſin, by which the vngodly are ſo ſmitten, that they flee from God, and chafe againſt him. And that is in the wicked, as in Cain, Saul, &amp; Iudas Iſcariot, of which feare mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is made, 1. Iohn. 4.18.</p>
               <p>Securitie, is to liue without care and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the feare of Gods anger,<note place="margin">Of ſecuritie.</note> and of his diuine iudgement againſt ſin. Pro. 28.14. Matt. 12.44.</p>
               <p>Securitie is two fold: either in the vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or in the godly.</p>
               <p>Securitie in the vngodly, or if you wil call it Epicureall &amp; giant-like contempt of God, is an amazednes or benummednes altogether neglecting the wrath and iudgment of God.</p>
               <p>Securitie in the godly, is a cold &amp; languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing feare of God, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſpecially appearing in them, when they be in proſperitie.</p>

               <p>Subiection vnto God, is that by which we ſubmit our ſelues to God, as to our Lord, to performe to him the obedience of the Law.</p>
               <p>The obedience of the law, is a perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie of al thoughts, motions, and actions, inward and outward, to the law of God.</p>

               <p>The adioynts of good workes in reſpect of men are two fold: either as concerning our ſelues, or our neighbour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:22308:98"/>In reſpect of our ſelues there are required chearefulnes, conſcience, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtancy, &amp; wiſdom.</p>
               <p>Chearefulneſſe is that, by which any man of his owne accord freely and willingly doth with ioy obey the lawe of God. Pſal. 40.9. &amp; 110.3. Col. 3.23.</p>
               <p>To it is oppoſed raſhnes &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pulſion: the former as diſagreeing, the other as contrary.</p>
               <p>Raſhnes is an inconſiderate forwardnes or wilfulnes of doing ſomething, vnder the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of obeying God, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as yet a man kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth not whether that which he doth or will doe, be commanded by God. And of this ſort is that rage that is in Idolaters, who are ready to exerciſe &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit Idolatry, and to do euery thing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded by their ſacrificing Prieſts.</p>
               <p>Compulſion is that, wherby a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, doth obey either for feare of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or for ſhame before others: therfore alſo ſuch an obedience is diſpleaſing vnto God.</p>
               <p>Conſcience is that ſparke of right reaſon, which remaineth in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as yet vndefaced, &amp; is that bewrayer &amp; iudge of good &amp; euil deeds. It is a bridle before ſin, ſometime to ſtay the rage of it, and a ſcourage after ſin committed, to afflict the heart or mind.</p>
               <p>Conſtancy is a perpetuall will and ſtudy to obey Gods law,<note place="margin">Of conſtancy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> or elſe it is a ſtable and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual abiding in the obedience of Gods law. Eph. 4.14.15. Dan. 1.8.</p>
               <p>Or elſe, Conſtancy is a perpetuall will to do good workes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:22308:99"/>To this there is oppoſed ſtubburnnes &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy: the one as diſparat or diſagreeing, the other as contrary.</p>
               <p>Stubburnnes is an abiding or perſeuering in euill, as in vngodly opinions, ſuperſtitions and wickednes contrary to conſcience.</p>
               <p>Inconſtancy is a raſh changing of the mind or will from good to euill. 2. Chron. 24.21. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem. 26.8.16.</p>
               <p>Wiſedome, is that by which wee obſerue comelineſſe in euery action. Eph. 5.15.16.17. that is to ſay, by which we obſerue what we are to doe, how, in what place, at what time, before whom, that all things may be done in a conuenient place, time, and manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of wiſedome.</note>Of wiſedom there are two parts, a percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing or foreſight, &amp; vprightneſſe of choice.</p>
               <p>A perceiuing or foreſight, is a carefull and diligent conſidering, what is comely in euery action. It is otherwiſe called circumſpection.</p>
               <p>The vprightnes of choiſe, is that by which we doe will &amp; chooſe that which we perceiue to be meete. Pſal. 119.173.</p>
               <p>Therefore by wiſedome, counſels and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberations are directed in the choiſe of honeſt and profitable things, and al actions ſo caried, that conueniencie of place, time, and perſons, and of other circumſtances is obſerued.</p>
               <p>So Paul willeth that our ſeruing of God be according to reaſon. Rom. 12.1. So the ſame Paul doth commaund vs to obſerue oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie in the exerciſe of vertues. Rom. 13.11.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:22308:99"/>Singular wiſdome is required in the choiſe of euill things.</p>
               <p>Of two euils the leſſe euill is to be choſen. But this rule is to be vnderſtood of the euill of the puniſhment which is contrary to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable goodneſſe, and not of the euill of the offence, contrary to honeſt goodneſſe. For if God forbid both euils, neither of them is to be done.</p>
               <p>Therefore in euils of offence or ſinne there muſt be no choiſe: that is to ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the euils of offence &amp; ſin it ſelfe, muſt at no hand be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, but all euils are to be ſhunned a like.</p>
               <p>In euils of puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t there may be choiſe, as if one being taken in warre, or falling into the hands of a theefe, might chuſe whether he will redeeme himſelfe with money, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will looſe his life: it is better to looſe his money, then his life.</p>
               <p>So 2. Sam. 24 12. To Dauid, when hee had ſinned by numbring the people, the Lord of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth a choiſe of three fold puniſhment, of which he ſhould chuſe one which he would, namely, either ſeuen yeares famine through the whole kingdome, or warre in which hee ſhould flee three moneths before his enemies purſuing him, or three daies peſtilence Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider now (ſaith the Prophet Gad) and looke what I ſhall anſwere to him that ſent mee. Therefore ſaith Dauid to God: I am diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed aboue meaſure: but it is better to fall into the hand of the Lord (becauſe his mercies are
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:22308:100"/>many) then into the hands of men.</p>
               <p>Of the euils wherof (euen for the profeſſion of true religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) choiſe is offered to one that is altogether innocent, no choiſe ought to bee made: but we muſt wait what God wil, &amp; pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently beare what ſoeuer the tyrant hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed: leaſt if thou chuſe willingly puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; death, thou wrap thy ſelfe in ſuſpition of hauing committed ſome wickednes, &amp; doſt giue occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſpread ſlanders of thy fame to the poſterity; for otherwiſe thou wouldſt not willingly haue choſen puniſhment, if thou hadſt not binguiltie to thyſelf of ſome fault. There is an exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of ſuch a ſpiritual wiſdom in the french hiſtory, in the prince of Condie himſelfe. Charles IX. ſent for the Condie to come to him, &amp; propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to him three co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, of which he ſhold chuſe one: namely to goe to Maſſe, or to death, or to perpetuall impriſonme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. The Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>die anſwered him, that he would (God ſo aſſiſting him) neuer ſo treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe as to chuſe the firſt. Of the other two he left the one or the other of them to the will &amp; pleaſure of the King, &amp; yet doubted not, but God would gouerne all that action by his prouidence.</p>
               <p>To wiſdome there is oppoſed wylineſſe, or deceipt, and raſhneſſe: the former as diſparate or diſagreeing, the other as contrary.</p>
               <p>Wylines is an obſeruation of our own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite in ſome thing, and that with the hurt of another. For wiſedome is in good things: but
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:22308:100"/>wilineſſe in euill things.</p>
               <p>Raſhneſſe is a wilfulneſſe or violence to do any thing without cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel &amp; reaſon. Pro. 15.22.</p>

               <p>Idolatry is a ſinne, when the worſhip that is due to God alone, is tranſlated to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Gen. 31.30.34. Exod. 12.12. Iere. 43.13. Exod. 32.1.2. &amp;c. Iud. 17.3.4.</p>
               <p>The worſhipping of bread, or of the God Maozim in the Papiſticall maſſe, and as alſo the worſhip of Images, are ſpeciall kinds of Idolatry.</p>
               <p>Superſtition, is a ſinne, when the effects of Gods fauour, or ſome naturall force, is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to a thing or geſture without Gods commaundement, or without natural cauſes. Col. 2.23. Gen. 32.32. Iud. 18.27. 1. Sam. 5.5. Act. 17.22.</p>
               <p>There are infinit kinds of this ſuperſtition amongſt the Papiſts: among which the exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſme, or as we may call it coniuration of creatures is notorious.</p>
               <p>Exorciſme is a ſuperſtition, through which the ſacrificing prieſt adiureth the euill ſpirit by heauenly things, and doth boldly enough, and by his authority, command him, that he depart out of the infant that is to be baptized.</p>
               <p>The worſhip of God, is either onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or elſe both inward and outward. Deu. 6.5. &amp; 10 12. Mat. 1.8.</p>

               <p>And that is the true knowledge of God, loue towards God, humility, confidence in God, and patience.</p>
               <p>The true knowledge of God, is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward worſhip of God, when we know God ſo, as he hath manifeſted himſelfe in his word.</p>
               <p>To it is contrary the ignorance of God, which is not to know thoſe things concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God, which euery one ought to know. Furthermore falſe opinions touching God, are contrary to it.</p>
               <p>Loue towards God, is the inward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, when we do loue God ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, that we do all his commaundements with a certaine ioyfulneſſe. 1. Ioh. 5.3. 1. Tim. 1. Deut<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6. Mat. 22.</p>
               <p>To it is contrary the hatred of God, which is by reaſon of the turning away of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from God, and from the iuſtice of God, and through inclination to ſinne, to flee from God, and to be angry with him, accuſing and puniſhing ſinne. Rom. 8.7.</p>
               <p>To it alſo is contrary, an inordinate loue of himſelf or of any of the creatures, which is to preferre a mans owne luſts, will, life, or glory, before Gods will and glory, and wickedly to neglect, and offend him rather then to forgoe thoſe things we loue. Mat. 10.37.</p>

Cor. 4.7. Iob. 1.21.</p>
               <p>Poore in ſpirite that is to ſay, humble, may he be ſaid to be, who doth acknowledge that he hath no good thing of his owne nature, or by himſelfe, but rather that he is naked and poore, and voide of all good things, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth all ſuch things freely from God.</p>
               <p>To it is oppoſed, a fained humility and pride.</p>

               <p>Diſtruſt is a ſinne, when any doth not reſt in God, nor ſtay vppon his helpe alone, but giueth place to fearefulneſſe, trembling and anguiſh, and doth ſeeke meanes and helpes forbidden and not graunted. 1. Sam. 28.5.6.7.8.</p>
               <p>Confidence in God, is either a liuely faith, or hope in God.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Faith doth receiue not only ſpirituall but euen bodily benefites alſo. Mat. 9.22. Chriſt ſayth to the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that had an iſſue of bloud; Thy faith hath ſaued thee.</p>
               <p>Therefore a liuely faith is either of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall or bodily good things.</p>
               <p>The proper duties thereof are two.</p>

               <p>Therefore alſo by that alone we are iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before God.</p>
               <p>To be iuſtified by faith onely in Ieſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes by faith.</note> is by faith alone as by a hand and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtrument to take hold of, and to apply to himſelfe the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by the obedience of his death.</p>
               <p>To a ſauing faith is oppoſed incredulity, doubting infolden or hidden faith, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary faith.</p>
               <p>Incredulity is that, which when a man hath heard and known Gods word, doth not conſent to the ſame, and ſpecially to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Grace.</p>
               <p>Doubting is neither fi mely to conſent to the word of God, &amp; in that word to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe

               <p>An infolden or hidden faith is to ſubmit his ſenſe obediently to the Church,<note place="margin">Of a hid faith.</note> and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue things not vnderſtood, and to embrace for trueth, whatſoeuer the Church hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and to poſt ouer to the Church the labour of enquiring and knowing the ſame, &amp; not to be carefull whether the Church pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe true things or not.</p>
               <p>This deuiſe of an infolden or hidden faith was inuented by ſchoolemen, and after them the Vbiquitaries haue diuerſly commended it, vnder which name, decking a moſt groſſe ignoraunce, they go about to delude the ſillie common people to their great deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>Temporarie faith, is to embrace the truth for a time, but without regeneration and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of the promiſe of the grace of God, and therefore in time of temptations and perſecutions, to be ouercome through hope of profit and honor, and to caſt away againe the profeſſion of the trueth.

               <p>Therefore our forgiuing is not the cauſe of Gods forgiuing.</p>
               <p>The aſſumption is certaine, for they only can pardon their bretheren, to whom God hath forgiuen their ſinnes: and by this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie we feele in our harts that our ſinnes are pardoned vs, if wee be fully purpoſed with our ſelues from our hearts to pardon all thoſe who haue offended vs.</p>

               <p>An idolatrous prayer, is that which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and made either to the fayned gods of the Gentiles, or to dead Saints: and of this ſort

               <p>The omitting of prayers, is a ſin when any doth omit praiers, as though he did not want the helpe and bleſſing of God.</p>
               <p>A vaine babling is the reciting of long or many prayers, with the vaine noyſe of the lips without the true motion of the hart, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith: hither pertaine the bellowing of the Monkes in the Churches.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of an oath.</note>An oath is a calling vpon God, by which we call him (as the onely ſearcher of the hart and raynes) for a witneſſe of our ſpeech, that ſo he may giue teſtimony to the truth, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueng and puniſh the deceipt, if we wittingly deceiue others thereby. Deut. 6.13. and 10.20. Rom. 1.9. 2. Cor. 1.23. &amp; 11.31. Phil. 1.8.</p>
               <p>The parts of an oath are two: that is, taking God to witneſſe, and curſing.</p>
               <p>Taking God to witneſſe, is that by which the ſwearer doth cite God as a witneſſe of his aſſeueration. Rom. 1.9. Deut. 6.13. &amp; 10.29. Ioſ. 23.7. Eſa. 65.16. Ier. 5.7. &amp; 12.16.</p>
               <p>Curſing is that by which the ſwearer doth vow and tie himſelfe to the puniſhment of periury, that he may be accurſed before
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:22308:112"/>God, and God may puniſh him, if he wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly deceiue. 1. King. 2.23.</p>
               <p>An oath is two fold: to wit, offered, or a voluntary oath of a mans owne accord.</p>
               <p>An offered oath, is that which is offered by the Magiſtrate or Iudge, or the aduerſe party: in Greeke it is called ſwearing. Heb. 6.16.</p>
               <p>A voluntary oath, or oath of a mans owne accord, but yet taken, a mans calling forcing him thereunto, is that which is done that we might defend either our owne or other mens good name &amp; life: as Paul by calling God to witneſſe, affirmeth that he ſpake the truth. Rom. 9.1.</p>
               <p>The refuſing of a lawful oath, and a wicked oath, are contrary to the religion of an oath.</p>
               <p>The refuſing of a lawfull oath is a ſin, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any doth refuſe to take an oath which either the Magiſtrate doth iuſtly require, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe neceſſitie demandeth, vnder this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that faith may bee confirmed, and the truth eſtabliſhed: that ſo both the glory of God may be ſet forth, and other mens ſafetie prouided for.</p>
               <p>A wicked oath is a ſinne, when a man doth ſweare againſt the law of God.</p>
               <p>And it is either a raſh oath, or an Idolatrous oath, or els periury, or of an vnlawfull thing.</p>
               <p>A raſh oath is when any ſweareth raſhly, &amp; without cauſe, of a certaine lightnes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane cuſtome: as if any being angry, ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that he will ſlay another.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:22308:112"/>An Idolatrous oath, is when a man ſweareth by Saints, or other creatures.</p>
               <p>Periurie is a ſinne, when any wittingly and willingly deceiueth by an oath, whether it be in giuing teſtimonie, or in profeſſing ſome thing of himſelfe, or in the promiſe of his owne will. Exod. 20.7. Leuit. 19.12. Matth. 5.33. Iam. 5.12.</p>
               <p>An oath of an vnlawfull thing is when any ſweareth that he will doe that which is contrary to Gods word. Such was that of Iephte and of Herod.</p>

               <p>The approbation of Gods workes, is a part of thankeſgiuing, when wee allow all things whatſoeuer God doth becauſe they are good, and therefore we do ſuffer them to pleaſe and like vs. So it becommeth vs alſo to allow of the iudgements of God, his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and gouerning of tempeſts, of calme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, of rayne, of wars, of our health, of our houſehold affayres and all other things.

               <p>The right eſtimation of Gods workes, is a part of the prayſing God, when we magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and extoll his workes. Pſal. 8.2. and ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and 104 throughout.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Of the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the truth.</note>The confeſſion of the truth is the worſhip of God, when we do openly without feare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the heauenly truth, as it is made knowen vnto vs out of the holy ſcripture. Matth. 10.32.
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:22308:113"/>1. Pet. 3.15.</p>
               <p>And that is done either with the mouth, or by martyrdome.</p>
               <p>With the mouth, when we doe without doubtfulneſſe and darkeneſſe profeſſe that which we thinke with our heart. Rom. 10.10.</p>
               <p>By martyrdome, when we giue teſtimony to the truth, by the croſſe: yea when God ſhal ſee it ſo good, by death it ſelfe. 1. Pet. 2.20. &amp; 3.14. &amp; 4.12. Phil. 1.29.</p>
               <p>To the confeſſion of the truth, is oppoſed hereſie, the corrupting of doctrine, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and omitting of doctrine, the ſhunning of doctrine, the tediouſneſſe of doctrine, an vnſeaſonable confeſſion, the diſſembling of truth, and denying of truth.</p>
               <p>Hereſie is a ſinne, when any erreth in the foundation of ſaluation,<note place="margin">Of hereſie.</note> and ſtiffely or ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnly perſeuerteh in his error.</p>
               <p>Therefore that wicked ſtubburnneſſe of franticke men in the puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts which they ſuffer, either for ſedition, as for example, of the Anabaptiſts, or for errors which are ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly blaſphemous, as of Seruetus, who was burnt at Geneua in the yeare 1552. is not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of truth.</p>
               <p>For theſe are not the martyrs of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the cauſe maketh a martyr not the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome, as Cyprian ſaith, and Apollinaris; Where the truth of Chriſt is not, there is not the truth of martyrdome.</p>
               <p>The corrupting of doctrine, is when men
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:22308:114"/>ſpread abroad any falſe thing of God or of his will.</p>
               <p>Blaſphemy is to ſpeake of God, thing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his nature and will. Leu. 24.</p>
               <p>The omitting of doctrine, is a neglect of oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions &amp; ability to teach others, &amp; to bring them to the knowledge of the truth, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our children or others, who are committed to our faithfulneſſe and care.</p>
               <p>The ſhunning of doctrine, is a ſinne, when any doth ſhun conferences and ſpeeches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God and heauenly things.</p>
               <p>Tediouſnes of doctrine is a ſin, when any is cloyed, as we ſay, with the fulneſſe of the word of God.</p>
               <p>An vnſeaſonable confeſſion, is that which is made without the neceſſity of a mans cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or of doing ſome duty: and therfore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the glory of God is ſet foorth by ſuch a confeſſion, neither the ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of any is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted, but rather eyther the ſcorning or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquie of the truth, or the fierceneſſe of the enemies is ſtirred thereby, ſpecially againſt the godly.</p>
               <p>The diſſembling of the truth, is a ſin, when any diſſembleth the truth, where the glory of God, and ſafety of his neighbour requireth a true and full confeſſion.</p>
               <p>The denying of the truth is a ſin, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any doth deny the truth after he hath certainely knowen it.</p>
               <p>The denying of the truth is two fold: either
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:22308:114"/>proceeding of infirmity, or willing.</p>
               <p>The former is when any being vpon the ſuddaine, and with preſent and vnlooked for feare, ouercome and compelled, doth with his mouth indeede deny the truth, and that to ſhun ſome danger, but neuertheleſſe keepeth it in his heart, neither falleth from it. Such a denying was that of Peter the Apoſtle who denyed Chriſt. Mat. 26.69. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>A willing denying of the truth is a ſin, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any denyeth the truth certainly knowen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ouercome and compelled with no ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine &amp; vnlooked for feare, but willingly &amp; of purpoſe, eyther to keepe dignity, or life, or for hope to obtaine ſubſtance and riches.</p>
               <p>And that is properly called Apoſtaſie, that is to ſay, a wicked falling away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the truth,<note place="margin">Apoſtaſie.</note> as was that of Iulian the Apoſtata, and Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Spira.</p>

               <p>The iudgement of Moſes is put downe, Deut. 22. chap. which commandeth her to be ſtoned with ſtones that was defiled by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which afterward (as though ſhe had bin a virgin) was married to another, if ſhe were accuſed, &amp; the man asked a diuorcement.</p>
               <p>The proceeding of the common law, is two fold: one before their lying together, another after their lying together.</p>
               <p>Before the lying together be committed, this proceeding is to be kept.</p>
               <p>Firſt reconciliation betweene them is to be aſſayed, that he who of error married her that was defiled by another, may keepe her, eſpecially if ſhe be modeſt, &amp; will afterward liue chaſtly.

               <p>But if the reconciliation doth not proceed, the diuorcement muſt be made.</p>
               <p>For it is better to follow the example of Moſes law, then other reaſons. For although the iudiciall lawes of Moſes doe not pertaine to our ſtates and places, yet we ſee in them what God alloweth.

               <p>The firſt, that their lightnes might not be ſtrengthened who willingly vpon euery and any pretext do forſake their wiues, by what meanes ſoeuer their mind be altered.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, leaſt through ſuſpicions or ſome ſmall offences, the innocent parties ſhould come into danger.</p>
               <p>The third is this, that ſecret faults may not be layd open, which is more honeſt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to be couered: according to the ſaying, Loue couereth all faults.</p>

               <p>In the vnequall line, wedlockes are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by Gods law, in the ſecond degree, becauſe generally God would haue more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence to be giuen to the ſuperior degree then to the equall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe theſe in the vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall line occupy the place of parents, &amp; chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. 1.
